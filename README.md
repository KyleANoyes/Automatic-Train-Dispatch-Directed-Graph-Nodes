# Automatic-Train-Routing-Directed-Graph-Nodes
Copy of my testing environment used when creating the direct graph node algorithm

This program is desgined to represent a model railraod using a directed graph node system to allow for automatic pathing of trains, modularize signals, and ensure greater flexability on any size layout

Context: This program is a proof of concept to augment the signal system in JMRI used at CGMRC (https://cgmrc.com/) with a more robust and modular pathing system
This will also be used for my own layout at home
