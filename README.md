# Automatic-Train-Routing-Directed-Graph-Nodes
Copy of my testing environment used when creating the direct graph node algorithm

This program is run off a coordinate based track layout and will successfully route choo choo's from one portion of a track to another, and negotiate any obstacles it encounters.

The code here is a test of automatic train dispatch capabilities to operate my layout in a completely autonomous manner


More testing needed to fix some self reversing actions, but waiting to update this until after CGMRC show is over and I have time agian :)
