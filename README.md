# Automatic-Train-Routing-Directed-Graph-Nodes
Copy of my testing environment used when creating the direct graph node algorithm

This program is run off a coordinate based track layout and will successfully route choo choo's from one portion of a track to another, and negotiate any obstacles it encounters.

The code here is a test of automatic train dispatch capabilities to operate my layout in a completely autonomous manner

Show is now complete and work is resuming on this üòÅ

Context: This script is designed as a proof of concept to augment our signal system in JMRI used at CGMRC (https://cgmrc.com/events) with a more robust and modular pathing system
This will also be used for my own layout at home
